Played it last year at Gencon (prototype copy) and this year at Gencon. I was impressed at the speed of play for a civ game. 6 players learned the game in 30min and played a full game in 90min. Honestly, it went too fast for me for a civ game. But, seems like one could shuffle scoring cards lower in the decks. This will be a great game for big player counts. Beautiful components. Got my KS copy. I really like this game! I think it plays well at 5 players, allowing a bit more engine building than at 6 players.

My review  httpstherewillbe.gamesarticles-boardgame-reviews8708-arkham-horror-living-card-game-the-greatest-deck-construction-introduction-of-all-time-if-you-can-get-there  This game completely changed my view on deck construction games but the initial wall is almost unimaginably high until you grok that it actually is an unforgiving, action-limited, strategy game and how much content is actually required to start enjoying the game. It's a weird position to have a game you've played at least a hundred times and have spent a truly staggering amount of money on but cannot recommend wholeheartedly.

Genuinely fun, very thinking while also being fairly easy to 'get'. Probably a good SDJ candidate. I haven't played the advance game yet, but I think I'd like it a little more. On the other hand, this game, while great, doesn't scratch that hardcore euro itch for me. It's a game I would buy for others who come over and aren't necessarily into super hard games like I am. I'd rate it right inbetween 'good - I'm usually willing to play' and 'very good - enjoy playing and would suggest it' it's not quite that second one, because in the end, if I'm with people who'd be willing to play a heavier game, I'd always take them up on the heavier game over this one. But if I'm with easier going game people, then this is right up there with the best in that category.

[2023.Mar.25] An interesting and thematic game composed of many of moving parts, dials to turn, and levers to pull. With the multitude of choices, the game can quickly mire down into a bit of a slog. Also, a player's success seems to be quite dependent upon the luck of the draw with respect to how the various cards enter play. I'd play again, but it wouldn't be my 1st or 2nd choice.

Lots of points for style.  It really isn't window dressing the theme fresh and it infused the game.  The concept and art are supercool.  There's also a couple of innovative mechanisms  1)  the fact that you can sometimes take two actions on your turn if you planned things right (and no one foiled them).  2)  the upgrade mechanism of making one action more effective while simultaneously making another action cost less was great and provides for a lot of strategy.  But I'm afraid there aren't enough nice trees to add up to a forest.  Many mechanisms (movement, combat and the flow of controlling territory) are clunky and chaotic.  The way the game ends is simply unsatisfying.  The variable powers didn't sit right for me and seems a cheap way to get flavor and replayability at the expense of undue complexity and arguments about fairness.  There are also downtime issues...but I'm going to chalk this up to my poor patience and the fact that I've only played five player.

(Played class the State) The experience is excellent even though when we found out we have some rules played wrong in the game. The game has a perfect theme in which the mechanism (of each class) is well fitted in the theme while giving players immersive gaming experience. The game is dynamic and the traction of different classes is quite tight, hence giving me great impression on player interaction. However, the later stage of the game is a bit repetitive. I hope adding the expansions to the game may fix this problem. I am looking forward to play with expansions.

Very beautiful open-world storybook game featuring lots of fantastic Ryan Laukat art.  The storytelling feels very generous--you can read entries most turns and many entries have a whole tree of choices you can follow within a single explore action.  It feels like you can see and do an incredible amount in a single campaign and yet there feels like so much more to explore.  This is truly a remarkable feat.  The combat is interesting and provides a nice change of pace.  The fatigue and wound mechanisms are necessary to make there be consequences for exploring.  I like that you rarely fail but instead succeed with negative consequences that you later have to manage.  The rating is not higher because everything else feels pretty meh.  There are 9 characters with multiple abilities each and huge decks of ability cards, level cards, and adventure cards that you can use to upgrade your actions.  But while you might have 50-60 places to spend command, all the options feel very samey--more like small variants of a few core abilities than anything really cool.  And some of these are clearly better than others, so what happens is that you'll have 50 options, but you'll have 8-10 that you regularly choose while ignoring the rest.  The rulebook even says you can basically put some of your cards away to save table space.  So, while there are definitely strategic decisions, you will probably make a strategic decision once and then just spam that same option a dozen more times.  I really wish there was a tech tree or crafting rules or something that could make these options synergize into increasingly interesting abilities.  Also, the rulebook and cards often have ambiguity and there are tons of fiddly tokens to manage constantly.    Still, while this game is not one you'd want to play solely for the gameplay mechanics (I can't imagine ever using the Arcade mode) they all serve to support the phenomenal storytelling aspects, so the overall experience is still great.  I also appreciate the diverse cast of characters who have actual stories and personalities integrated into the adventure, which is so cool.

Not the most exciting game, but a really neat puzzle with a lot of easy to learn mechanism that integrate beautifully together.  Every game is different depending on the cards getting out. Some of the games are more interesting than others depending on the draw. If you accept that this is a game of optimization more than a game of strategy where you have control over eveything, it is a whole lot of fun.

Played with 3. On first play, I thought this was really fun. Lots of interesting decisions with some cool mechanics. It seems like there are a lot of paths to victory. I didn't like the personal goals, but there seems to be an official variant for that. I find tracks a little tough to read, but I think it's worth it to just get used to them. The endgame is kind of brutal. The end can come much faster than you might anticipate, and if you aren't ready, you will get smoked. I'm looking forward to trying more of it.

Yet another take on Arkham Horror, with more collectible aspect but still all the familiar and loved characters, monsters and arcane items.   This is a good coop card game, the deckbuilding aspect gives a fresh take on how to prepare for the adventure, but the actual contents are quite predictable, not fixing what isn't broken. One complain I have is, that the story cards (Acts) try to give a deeply immersing story, but then the actual player decks and encounters quite heavily break the suspension-of-disbelief. For example the story says you hear monsters outside, but then in actual encounters monsters directly attack you. More directed deck preparation could have fixed this.  Owned by a friend.

It's an excellent game, just a bit too much - to set up, to teach, to fit on the table, and to remember. Which would still be OK, however the theme doesn't resonate with me. +A Feast for Odin, The Norwegians, +Mini Expansion #2

It is a fine euro. Light, quick to learn, and quick to play competently, but it does not feel like I had much of a chance to make good plays, especially playing 4 player where the available tiles change drastically between turns.

This game has so much going for it, many ways to win, variety in the staring setups (random faction and player board).  A great game.

Feels like a modern-age classic. It's big, absolutely beautiful and quite easy to learn. It manages to be arguably the most thematic of all eurogames while still being clever and with very few random elements.  On the downside not enough player interaction, especially with fewer players.

Fun at lower player counts only. This game can actually be a bit cut-throat at 2-3 players. Denying opponents tiles they need, or even better, choosing tiles in a way that forces them to fill their floor with negative points.

What really makes this game shine is how easy it is to teach. Within one game most players have a good understanding of strategy that they want to pursue.  The game is abstract, but not math-y enough to lose players' attention. The player mats are made of thick plastic coated cardboard and the tiles are a nice painted resin. This is a fantastic game for a picnic table, as the wind wont blow the heavy plastic tiles out of the way.  What could be done better is the point tracking system.  That small cube always slides around the slippery surface of the player boards.

Game just feels a bit bloated with too much to keep track of and without tight choices. Seven Wonders plus Concordia without the elegance of either.
