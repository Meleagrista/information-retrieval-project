bash the leader: when, to prevent the victory of whoever is first, the players are forced to take actions against him, often to the detriment of their own advantage or in any case without gaining anything directly. At the table, the unfortunate situation can arise whereby one or more must "sacrifice" themselves to curb the leader and let the others benefit from this conduct.

complicated vs complex: A game is complicated the more the rules are quantitatively many and qualitatively equipped with exceptions. Once you understand and learn all the variables, a game (that is only) complicated is not difficult to master. In a complicated game, solving a problem leads to immediate, certain and predictable results.
A game is as complex as the repercussions of one's actions are difficult to predict and master. Even once you understand and learn all the variables, a complex game is still difficult to master. In a complex game, solving one problem leads to other problems.
