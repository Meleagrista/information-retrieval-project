A centralized hub for organizing code, documentation, and resources related to my academic project. Stay tuned for the detailed report titled: Efficient Analysis of User Comments in Board Game Reviews: Topic Identification and Evaluation.

# Abstract
This scientific report presents a project focused on analyzing user comments from board game
and expansion reviews. The aim is to identify specific aspects of the games, such as luck depen-
dency, bookkeeping or downtime, player interaction, advantage discrepancies, and rule complexity.
The project also aims to develop a user-friendly system that minimizes human involvement for
program execution. A original approach is employed to construct a selective topic identification
dictionary, considering user-specific needs. Challenges related to abstract topic detection and bias
towards tangible aspects are discussed. The system design involves corpus extraction, preprocess-
ing, dictionary generation, LDA topic modeling, and manual labeling. The project provides insights
into efficient topic identification and analysis of user comments in board game reviews.
