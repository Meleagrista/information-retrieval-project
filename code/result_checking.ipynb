I'd rate it right inbetween 'good - I'm usually willing to play' and 'very good - enjoy playing and would suggest it' it's not quite that second one, because in the end, if I'm with people who'd be willing to play a heavier game, I'd always take them up on the heavier game over this one.

      "Lots of points for style.  It really isn't window dressing: the theme fresh and it infused the game.  The concept and art are supercool.  There's also a couple of innovative mechanisms:  1)  the fact that you can sometimes take two actions on your turn if you planned things right (and no one foiled them).  2)  the upgrade mechanism of making one action more effective while simultaneously making another action cost less was great and provides for a lot of strategy.  But I'm afraid there aren't enough nice trees to add up to a forest.  Many mechanisms (movement, combat and the flow of controlling territory) are clunky and chaotic.  The way the game ends is simply unsatisfying.  The variable powers didn't sit right for me and seems a cheap way to get flavor and replayability at the expense of undue complexity and arguments about fairness.  There are also downtime issues...but I'm going to chalk this up to my poor patience and the fact that I've only played five player.\n",

      "Very beautiful open-world storybook game featuring lots of fantastic Ryan Laukat art.  The storytelling feels very generous--you can read entries most turns and many entries have a whole tree of choices you can follow within a single explore action.  It feels like you can see and do an incredible amount in a single campaign and yet there feels like so much more to explore.  This is truly a remarkable feat.  The combat is interesting and provides a nice change of pace.  The fatigue and wound mechanisms are necessary to make there be consequences for exploring.  I like that you rarely fail but instead succeed with negative consequences that you later have to manage.  The rating is not higher because everything else feels pretty meh.  There are 9 characters with multiple abilities each and huge decks of ability cards, level cards, and adventure cards that you can use to upgrade your actions.  But while you might have 50-60 places to spend command, all the options feel very samey--more like small variants of a few core abilities than anything really cool.  And some of these are clearly better than others, so what happens is that you'll have 50 options, but you'll have 8-10 that you regularly choose while ignoring the rest.  The rulebook even says you can basically put some of your cards away to save table space.  So, while there are definitely strategic decisions, you will probably make a strategic decision once and then just spam that same option a dozen more times.  I really wish there was a tech tree or crafting rules or something that could make these options synergize into increasingly interesting abilities.  Also, the rulebook and cards often have ambiguity and there are tons of fiddly tokens to manage constantly.    Still, while this game is not one you'd want to play solely for the gameplay mechanics (I can't imagine ever using the Arcade mode) they all serve to support the phenomenal storytelling aspects, so the overall experience is still great.  I also appreciate the diverse cast of characters who have actual stories and personalities integrated into the adventure, which is so cool.   \n",

This is a good coop card game, the deckbuilding aspect gives a fresh take on how to prepare for the adventure, but the actual contents are quite predictable, not fixing what isn't broken. One complain I have is, that the story cards (Acts) try to give a deeply immersing story, but then the actual player decks and encounters quite heavily break the suspension-of-disbelief. For example the story says you hear monsters outside, but then in actual encounters monsters directly attack you. More directed deck preparation could have fixed this.  Owned by a friend.\n",

One just has to get familiar with all the cards and achievements etc.     Things I didn't like: The illustration of the board is not clean. Too busy with all the tokens on the board! The game did not provide some essential components (point tracker, symbol tracker)  Too many moving parts and cards in a player's area. So hard to keep track of other player's plan/strategy.\n",

Efficiency is rewarded in this game big time and a few mistakes (wasted turns) will cost you.  More opportunity to be foiled by other players actions than TM, but careful players can counteract.  Fun game that lives up to the hype for me.  Will also add that the Tabletop Simulator version is of high quality.  After many plays though, certain boards feel like your optimal overarching strategy is predetermined. \n",
